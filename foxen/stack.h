 * be used to inform valgrind that this memory region is indeed a stack (if
 * valgrind support is compiled in by setting the `with_valgrind` flag in meson
 * and/or defining the FX_WITH_VALGRIND pre-processor flag.). Furthermore, there
 * is an assertion in place that makes sure that
 * `stack_start < stack_ptr <= stack_end`.
 *
 * @param stack_start is the low-address of the memory region that should be
 * used as a stack.
 * @param stack_end is the high-address of the memory region that should be used
 * as a stack.
 * @param stack_ptr is a the actual memory address at which the called function
 * should be executed. Normally you want to set this to stack_end.
 * @param cback is the callback function that should be executed within the new
 * stack.
 * @param data is a user-defined pointer that should be passed to the callback
 * function.
 * @return the return value returned by the callback function.
